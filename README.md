# weather-dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard application allows a user enter a city name and retrieve the current weather and five day forecast on the same screen! Searches are saved and users may click a history button to display weather information again for that city. Saved searches may also be cleared. This application uses the Weather API - Open Weather Map to retrieve weather data that is displayed to the page using JavaScript and styled/designed by Bootstrap and CSS. In building this application, I've learned how to implement API calls into my webpages using JavaScripts fetch function to display data. This opens up new possibilities in my development as I can now bring applications together to share data.

## Usage

This weather dashboard application may be used to view the current weather and five day forecast of a given city. This can help in many ways from planning what you're going to wear outside to planning ahead for outdoor activities! Enter a city name into the input box and click "search". Weather information for your chosen city will automatically populate. Feel free to make multiple searches without fear of losing your data. Your history will be saved and can be viewed by clicking the generated history button. If you'd like to clear your search history, click the "clear history" button. Students and new developers may find it helpful to view the code to see how API data was used in the implementation of this application. Code has been commented to describe functionality. Searches are saved via local storage. If you'd like to view your local storage, open the Chrome DevTools Console, click the "application" tab, and view the local storage section.
